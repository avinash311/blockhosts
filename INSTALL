    blockhosts.py          

REQUIREMENTS:
------------

    1: BlockHosts 3.0.0+ Python 3
       BlockHosts 2.7.0 and older Python 2.3

    2: Primarily uses host control facility and related files such as
       hosts.access. If not using TCP/IP blocking, then the extensions to
       the access control language as described in the man 5 hosts_options
       page are required, which allow use of :allow and :deny keywords.
       ["...extensions  are  turned  on  at program build time by
       building with -DPROCESS_OPTIONS..."]

    3: If not using host control facilities (tcpd, hosts.access, etc),
       then there needs to be a way to trigger the run of blockhosts.py,
       or blockhosts.py should be run periodically using cron. Secondly,
       there must be some way to update a file to list the blocked ip
       (for example, hosts.deny file, or Apache .htaccess file, etc).
       Alternately, all TCP/IP communication can be blocked by using those
       facilities of blockhosts.py
       

INSTALLATION/UPGRADE
--------------------

In short:
        1: save any locally modified configuration file, for example
           /etc/blockhosts.cfg

        2: run the installer, it will overwrite all old files.
           Extract source, and run:
           [sudo] python3 setup.py install --force

        3: configure using /etc/blockhosts.cfg and /etc/hosts.allow, to
           run blockhosts.py as required at the site

Verify:
        [sudo] blockhosts.py --verbose

----------------------- non-RPM install/upgrade ----------------------
Extract the source package into a local directory, and then follow the
upgrade or install instructions below to install the script and config
file - note that this procedure does not copy over the doc files.

Upgrade:
---------
  Note: If you have locally modified the /etc/blockhosts.cfg file,
  save a copy, before proceeding.

  If you have an older version, but have not modified any blockhosts files
  locally (such as /etc/blockhosts.cfg), then use this command:

    [sudo] python3 setup.py install install --force

  If you have locally modified the /etc/blockhosts.cfg file, save a copy,
  run the above command, and then merge your changes into the local file.
  To install without overwriting your local file (this may cause problems
  if the .cfg file format or data fields have changed), run:

    [sudo] python3 setup.py install

Fresh install:
-------------

    [sudo] python3 setup.py install --force

To see what will be installed without actually installing files, run:

    [sudo] python3 setup.py --dry-run install --force

May need sudo to copy files in correct places.

----------------------- First Run ---------------------------------------

After the configuration is as you want it (see next section for
Configuration), then run this program manually, usually as root:
    blockhosts.py --verbose
(use --dry-run if you don't want any output file to be updated).

The first run will scan through the entire system logs, so it will add a
number of hosts to the block list. 

If you run blockhosts.py immediately again, it will most likely report no
updates to the blocked hosts list.

The large number of hosts added will be removed after the "discard"
interval.  By default, this is 12 hours, and from then on,
blockhosts.py will keep track of the new lines seen in the system logs,
and will only add new hosts that are attacking sshd/proftpd.

[The reason a large number of hosts are added on the first run is due to
the way blockhosts.py assigns "time last seen" to each host - to keep
things simple, blockhosts.py does not look at the system log times, but
just uses the current date/time when blockhosts.py was run. This is 
sufficient for the purpose of determining which host to block.]


----------------------------- Configuration ---------------------------

/etc/blockhost.cfg:
  Configuration file should be used, to customize the run of
  blockhosts.py. The default name of the config file is /etc/blockhosts.cfg
  Edit this file, and change any parameter as required for your platform. 
  The defaults work for Fedora FC7 platform, using OpenSSH and ProFTPD.
  The LOGFILES line is probably the most important one - names of system
  logs where sshd and proftpd write information may be different on your
  system from the defaults.
  The config file can also be used to enable mail notifications, and use
  ip null routing or iptables blocking.

/etc/hosts.allow (or /etc/hosts.deny) - the hosts block file
  Add following sections, in this order:
  -- your permanent allowlist and denylist of IP addresses (if needed)
  -- blockhosts marker lines - two lines
  -- execute command to kick off blockhosts.py on connects to services

Example below, you can copy the following lines in entirety to your
/etc/hosts.allow, and edit as needed.
Example applies to either hosts.allow or hosts.deny, best to use a single
file - hosts.allow, and ignore the other file entirely:

# ----
# see "man 5 hosts_access" for details of the format of IP addresses,
#services, allow/deny options. Also see "man hosts_options"
#order of lines in this file is important, first matched IP address line
#is rule applied by hosts_access
#
# the following lines show how to use hosts.allow syntax to create
# allowlists and denylists - this works if invoking blockhosts.py from
# hosts.allow file. If using cron to run blockhosts, look into
# using the blockhosts.cfg for specifying allowlists and denylists.

# permanent allowlist addresses - these should always be ALLOWED access - edit
# as needed, following is example to show syntax only.
ALL: 127.0.0.1  : allow
ALL: 192.168.0. : allow
# permanent denylist addresses - these should always be DENIED access - edit
# as needed, following is example to show syntax only.

ALL: 10.  : deny
ALL: 192. : deny
ALL: 172. : deny

# ----------------------------------------
# next section is the blockhosts section - it will add/delete entries in
# between the two marker lines (#---- BlockHosts Additions)

#---- BlockHosts Additions
#---- BlockHosts Additions

# ----------------------------------------
# finally, the command to execute the blockhosts script, based on
# connection to particular service or services, for example, for
# sshd, proftpd, etc - if using pure-ftpd, etc, be sure to use those
# words instead - this is spread over multiple lines, so has \ at end of
# line to signal continuation:

sshd, proftpd, vsftpd: ALL: spawn /usr/bin/blockhosts.py \
     --echo "%c-%s" --ipblock=iptables \
     --allowlist="10\..*,127.0.0.1" --denylist="192.168.1.1,192.168.1.2" \
#---
# for more help on all the options, run:
#        blockhosts.py --help
#---
# use --ipblock="ip route" to enable null-routing,
# or use --ipblock=iptables to enable packet filtering,
# either of which blocks all network communication from blocked hosts
#---
# add for  email notification - email sent on newly blocked address,
# expired blocking, or errors/warnings. Optionally add --verbose for
# more info.
# --mail --verbose
#---
# add for  extra logging to blockhosts.log, if needed for debugging:
# --verbose >> /var/log/blockhosts.log 2>&1 &
# or
# --debug >> /var/log/blockhosts.log 2>&1 &
# without this, it will still log to syslog (errors/warnings/notices),
# so logging to another file is not usually necessary.
#---
# above commands will use default config file - /etc/blockhosts.cfg, edit
# it as needed to specify local configuration options

# See "man hosts.allow" for info on %c and %s identifiers

# for non-verbose, with identification, to syslog only (/var/log/messages),
# triggered on any service (using ALL as first word):
#ALL: ALL: spawn /usr/bin/blockhosts.py --echo "%c-%s" & : allow
#----
# To test hosts.allow, and to find out exact names of SSH/FTP services,
# add this line to the beginning of hosts.allow, use ssh/ftp to connect
# to your server, and then look at the log (/var/log/messages or
# blockhosts.log) to see the name of the invoked service.
# IMPORTANT: after your test is done, remove this line from hosts.allow!
# Otherwise everyone will always have access.
#ALL : ALL: spawn (/usr/bin/blockhosts.py --verbose --echo "%c-%s" >> /var/log/blockhosts.log 2>&1 )& : allow

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
Email Notification Support

Use the --mail to enable email notification support.

The mail notifier can be run to email notice of newly blocked/expired
addresses, by adding the --mail option to the run of blockhosts.py,
for example:

sshd: ALL: spawn /usr/bin/blockhosts.py --verbose --mail & : allow

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
Logwatch Support

BlockHosts ships with logwatch scripts - this can be used to get
summary emails of blockhosts.py activity. Since blockhosts.py always
logs Notices as well as Errors/Warnings to the system log, there is
no special option needed to blockhosts.py to enable these summaries.

The default install of blockhosts will install the following logwatch
files:
    /etc/logwatch/conf/services/blockhosts.conf
    /etc/logwatch/scripts/services/blockhosts
Detail level 0 (low) of logwatch will print summaries, and detail level
medium (5) will print out blocked and unblocked IP addresses also.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
Null Routing and Packet Filtering Blocking

Use the --ipblock="ip route" or --ipblock=iptables options to enable
null routing or packet filtering blocking.

Example:
sshd: ALL: spawn /usr/bin/blockhosts.py --echo "%c-%s" --ipblock="ip route" & : allow

Root permission for the run of blockhosts.py script is needed, since
only root can change routing tables or install iptables rules. This works
properly with correct permissions, if using hosts.access/hosts.deny to
run this script.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are using extra logging, and following above examples using the
file name /var/log/blockhosts.log, then it is probably useful to use some
sort of logrotation, so the log file does not get too large.

An example configuration for logrotate.d is provided, and the RPM package
installs it in the /etc/logrotate.d folder, manual install process is:
   cp   logrotate   /etc/logrotate.d/blockhosts

Note that it is not necessary to use the extra logging, and
blockhosts.log is not necessary - there will be some logging done using
syslog (usually goes to /var/log/messages), which is usually sufficient for
a working system. In which case, there is no need to do any logging to
blockhosts.log.
